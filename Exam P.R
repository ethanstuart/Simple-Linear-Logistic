#Conditional Probability
# Exaplanatory variable: GPA
#Response: Exam P (Pass or fail) Two categories(binary). 
# Did student pass examp? yes or no. Y=0 or 1

#response variable
xp$Pass <- ifelse(xp$ExamP=="Passed",1,0)

#in our model gpa will be on the x axis while probability of passing
#will be on the y axis. There are constraints (prob can't be above 1 or below 0)
# curve will be s-shaped/sigmoidal (kind of like a cdf.)
# We don't have dots that'll follow the line here, they are either 1 or 0.

###Logistic Regression####
# model: log(p(pass|gpa)/p(nopass|gpa))= Bo + B1GPA (no "E" or "normality") 
#because we're modeling conditional prob not data
# Note: Instead of modeling PROBABILITY, we model log(ODDS)
log(1)
#odds is prob/complement
#Probability    Odds    log(Odds)
# .5/(.5)         1       0
# .95(/.05)       19      log(19)=2.944
# .2              .25     log(.25) = -1.39

# The model for logodds can go negative and positive with the middle being 0
# Y ~ Bernoulli. Not modelling Y, we model the probability.
# Note: you can show p(pass|gpa) = 1/(1+exp(-(Bo+B1GPA)) p(nopass|gpa)= exp(-(Bo+B1GPA))/(1+exp(-(Bo+B1GPA)))

#Model
#log(P(pass|gpa)/P(notpass|gpa))= beta0 + beta1 GPA  . . .  this is "logistic pass"

# For a one unit increase in GPA we estimate the log odds of passing increase by 2.246. Or just say "it's positive"
# For a one unit increase in GPA (for example, moving from 2.5 to 3.5) we estimate the odds of passing
# increase 9.54 times. (exp(2.256)) times because it used to be log but now we multiply

# Does GPA have a statistically significant effect on passing?

#Ho: B1=0. z-test(summary) or LRT Chi^2(anova of reduced+ish) or 95% CI on B1
# z-test. We reject Ho:B1=0 in favor of Ha: B!=0 at Ã¥=0.05/OR GPA has a statistically significant effect on odds 
#of passing Exam P.(pvalue=0.0329)

#don't worry about the last two parts.

# Research and analysis, etc.
  # The data matches the research task and analysis perfectly. We were able to estimate the effect
# of GPA on the probability of passing exam P.

#weakness: Due to the amount of data provided, the interval for our prediction is very wide, and does not
# include any information about potential students in the lower end of GPA. Thus the prediction in that area
# is most likely flawed. 

#Challenge:
#Using data  on the Titanic from http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3.xls
# s investigate the effect of age on whether or not passengers survived the accident.
